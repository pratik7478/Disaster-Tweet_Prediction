# Disaster-Tweet_Prediction


I have used the natural language process for solving this problem statement.
Cleaning the data where the data have all the tweet and which is unreadable so cleaning and making the data readable. Then the text were manually classified whether the tweet referred to a disaster event or not (a joke with the word or a movie review or something non-disastrous). #target Denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)
